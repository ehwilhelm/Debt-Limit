## Public Debt Limit

Why have a debt ceiling?

-   Existed since founding of US federal government
-   Congressional artifact that frequently gets surpassed and muddies budget negotiations
-   Doesn't constrain spending

Why does it still persist?

<u>Interest Groups</u>

-   Particularly those with a vested interest in limiting the growth of future tax revenues
-   What are some other long-lived organizations who would want to limit the amount of future capital value the government could expropriate?
    -   Businesses
    -   Corporations
    -   Senior citizens?
    -   Domestic or Foreign?
